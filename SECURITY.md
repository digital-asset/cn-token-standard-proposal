# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repository serves as a staging place for code that is ultimately
meant to be contributed as a CIP to https://github.com/global-synchronizer-foundation/cips.

There are thus no supported versions before the corresponding CIP has been published.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Until the CIP is published, you can report any issue (with or without security impact)
by opening an issue on GitHub:
https://github.com/digital-asset/cn-token-standard-proposal

For general questions about this token standard proposal refer to its
[CIP discussion thread](https://lists.sync.global/g/cip-discuss/topic/towards_canton_network_token/110627661)
and the [CIP discussion mailing list](https://discuss.daml.com/) in general.

**Once the CIP is published and there are live implementations**:
If you suspect that your issue has a security impact, do not use the issue tracker.
In that case, please follow the responsible disclosure policies of the implementors
of the standard.

For implementations maintained by Digital Asset, please follow the responsible disclosure policy at
